		<h1>Securtiy Assesment of Historical Landmarks</h1>
		<p>Jordan Nagy 04&#47;25&#47;16</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This evaluation explores the security and privacy vulnerabilities of my partner's Historic Landmark page and server (Comp 20 Assignments 2 and 3, respecitvely). Their client specified that the historic landmark page will use the Google Maps API to render a map, displaying the user's location and the location of all other checkins to the page. The user's location will then be sent to the server and all of the historic landmarks within a mile will be sent back to the page. The page will then add these landmarks to the map along with the user's location and the other checkins.<br>I will conduct testing to evaluate these weeknesses, by finding ways in which the application can be exploited to violate privacy or render it unusable.</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>To begin testing, the "black-box" method was used first to test my partner's code without reviewing it. Then, after reviewing her code, more logic errors and vulnerabilities were found. I used curl and the url entered in the web browser to exloit these vulnerabilities I found. I ran her assignment locally, so I had to make a slight change to connect with local mongo.</p>

		<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
		<p>The vulnerabilites of this web application range from mild to severe, and can render the application unusable. The main source of these flaws stems from too much trust in user input. Instead of trusting the user to input correct data, the application should take active measures to disablize any attempts of malicious user input. Currently, the application has little to no security and only takes precautions against a select few cases of an incorrect login input.</p>
